Two substantial changes were made from the previous version (1.0:
	1) the removal of superflous code, most of which was already commented out, and
	2) the ability to move the playing field


Additional changes that I would like to include (1.1):
	A) make the playing field adjust its size depending on the browser size
		I) Leave room at the top for website 'banner'
			i) banner will disappear when animation is running, but return when pausing
		II) Leave room for a bottom-panel when the user will interact with the animation/game
			i) potential buttons for gameplay
			ii) pause-button, unless animation stope when pressing the animation itself
			iii) reset-button
			iv) settings-button
	B) Seperate the inital field-content-generating and the settings-changes in the menu
